So... what to say about me.. let me think..
Well I started to face computers when I was 12 years old. 
My parents bought me a C64. The blinking of the cursor was so hypnotic to me. Probably the reason I am a programmer is that C64 had the best user's [manual](https://ia802908.us.archive.org/21/items/Commodore_64_Microcomputer_Manuale_duso_1982_Commodore_IT/Commodore_64_Microcomputer_Manuale_duso_1982_Commodore_IT.pdf) of the entire history.

This manual tought me the basic of computer programming (basic), the programming of sprites and sid (sound interface device).
When I was 13 I started to program C64 in assembly. 

After that I moved to Amiga and learned to program it in assembly. 

I founded an hacker group with many BBS all around the world. 

In 1991 I started electronic engineering. During the university I learned Linux and I went very deep into C programming, calcoulous, network and parallel programming techniques.

I started my working career in 1999. I learned PHP, Html, Mysql. I have written tons of code ranging from booking, ecommerce single shop, CRM, CMS and so on.

I graduated in 2002.
In 2003 I have started a company named Catnic S.r.l. focoused on software development and hosting solutions

At 2006 I have bought my first mac and I have started programming IOS devices. I have created and published a lot of apps. 
Those for Android were done using Cordova sdk.
I have learned Objective C and (later) swift.

In 2016 I have started to learn angular1 and I have moved to angular 2 in 1018. I have adopted  IONIC as my first choice platform for mobile development.

On the while I have studied more or less anything about videogames like game engines, 3d modelling software, texturing, normals baking, physics simulation software and so on
Other interests cover blockchain technologies and machine learning theory and techniques. 

My current occupation is software developer at a very smart team into the BNL bank named "webteam". I am in charge of creating a new framework for internal usage based on Angular + Expressive
